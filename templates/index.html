      <p>
        ProjectXYZ is an automated and easy-to-use real estate website that utilizes Google's Earth Engine to populate listings with satellite data, providing prospective buyers with the information they need to make informed decisions and explore opportunities in distant lands. 
        Simply plot out your property from the comfort of your home or by walking its periphery, and watch as it populates with parameters such as population density, average rainfall, average temperature, soil organic content, average cloud cover, and much more, including on-ground data collected from locals. 
        You can even discover how your property compares to its vicinity, district, state, country, or even the world as we scale up. Not interested in selling unless you receive a very good price for it? No problem. List your property accordingly and receive recommendations on how it can be used to generate value, 
        such as through leasing it out, planting trees, and more, all of which can be seen instantaneously on your screen and entirely without human interaction.

  <div style="position: absolute; bottom: 0px; padding: 10px;" ><p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Footnote:</b> Website/mobile app is in very early stages, please do not share unnecessarily. ProjectXYZ is a cog in a larger overarching idea, and will be listed as a non-profit in order for the parent organization to open up this wing’s true potential, 
    ranging from opportunities for city dwellers to interact with and experience the countryside to agrivoltaics and reforestation of abused forests etc.      
    Trees are life. Just go out on a highway and picture what life would be like living in a home on a barren piece of land and how different the same house
    would be if it had trees surrounding it. </p> </div>
